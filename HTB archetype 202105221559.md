# HTB archetype 202105221559

- started with an nmap scan as per walkthrough documents
- this shows a variety of open ports, as well as a SQL server and SMB ports
- use `smbclient` to investigate the smb ports, shows a backup folder which may be interesting.
- prod.dtsConfig had an interesting line
	- ```<ConfiguredValue>Data Source=.;Password=M3g4c0rp123;User ID=ARCHETYPE\sql_svc;Initial Catalog=Catalog;Provider=SQLNCLI10.1;Persist Security Info=True;Auto Translate=False;</ConfiguredValue>```
	- ==Password=M3g4c0rp123; UserID=sql_svc==
- Able to use these details to access the SQL server using [[impacket 202105301607 | impackets]] `mssqlclient.py`
- from here with some struggle, and ending up using the reverse shell script from the walkthrough was able to access the user.txt file in the user profile.
	- #todo learn about reverse shell scripts 
- additionally was able to access the ConsoleHost_history.txt
	- #important - check powershell console history etc.
- this lead to admin creds and was able to use [[impacket 202105301607#psexec| impackets]] `psexec.py` from the impacket docker container
